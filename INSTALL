Currently, only linux amd64 is supported for building, but the code
emitter has been tested on i386 too.

You need a linux amd64 machine with go 1.5

type "make" in the dir with the Makefile to build scc for linux-amd64.

the subc directory/ contains the scc code from SubC distribution
it contains the libs and compiler code we will compile using our compiler.

It will build the scc, our compiler in the bin/ dir and sccb, a compiler
that compiled itself, just for fun.
