Currently, only linux amd64 is supported for building, but the code
emitter has been tested on i386 too.

You need a linux amd64 machine with the most recent version of go.

type "make" in the dir with the Makefile to build scc for linux-amd64.

the subc directory/ contains the scc code from SubC distribution
it contains the libs and compiler code we will compile using our compiler.

"make" will build "scc", our compiler in the bin/ dir and "sccb", a compiler
that compiled itself, just for fun.

There is also an assembler "sas" that can assemble code generated by "scc".
It is not a complete assembler, but a bare mininum set to assemble "scc" code ouput.

The tool "objcmp" is used to compare assembler object files generated "sas"
and a more complete assembler such as the GNU assembler, to make sure
we generate the right object files.

To use the compiler, you need to set the SCCROOT environment variable to point
to the gosubc directory. The compiler will use this folder to look for the
runtime libraries and standard headers. 
By default, the compiler will try to use the executable location of 
where it is to determine SCCROOT.
